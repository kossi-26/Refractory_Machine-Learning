# Refactory Data Science and Advanced Machine Learning Program - Final Project

## Project Title
**Student Dropout Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## Overview
This project builds a predictive model to identify students at risk of dropping out using academic, demographic, and socioeconomic data.  
The goal is to help educational institutions detect at-risk students early and take proactive measures to improve retention.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and evaluation for binary classification  
- Prediction of student dropout probability based on key factors
