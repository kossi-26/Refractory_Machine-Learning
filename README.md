# Refactory Data Science and Advanced Machine Learning Program - Final Project

## Project Title
**Student Dropout Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## Overview
This project builds a predictive model to identify students at risk of dropping out using academic, demographic, and socioeconomic data. The goal is to help educational institutions detect at-risk students early and take proactive measures to improve retention.
## Problem Statement
Student dropout is a critical issue in education systems, especially in developing regions. It leads to wasted resources, lost potential, and long-term socioeconomic consequences. Our goal is to build a predictive model that flags students likely to drop out, enabling timely support.
## Dataset
Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset
Size: 4,424 students, 37 original features
Enhancements: Location_Type: Urban vs. Rural
Internet_Access: Connectivity score
Teacher_Quality: Qualification score
School_Distance_km: Distance to school
These features were simulated to reflect Tanzanian educational realities.
## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and evaluation for binary classification  
- Prediction of student dropout probability based on key factors
